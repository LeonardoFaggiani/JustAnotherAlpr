# Just Another ALPR

This is a proof of concept of how to train my own `YOLO` model to detect vehicle license plates.

`Darknet` is used as a framework and the `YOLO` algorithm to detect license plates, `YOLOv4-tiny` is used because the main idea is to be able to detect license plate in real time.

On the other hand, I used `Python` to draw and manipulate the steaming of the video.

## TODO

* [ ] Upload differents kind of images to train the model. üõ†Ô∏è (In Progress)
* [ ] Create Model
* [ ] Draw boxes in video streaming
* [ ] OCR
* [ ] Information of the owner of the vehicle license (Simulation)
